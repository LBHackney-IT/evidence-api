# 3. Use ASP.NET for Platform APIs

Date: 2020-12-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Previous APIs at Hackney have been written in a variety of languages and frameworks, including Ruby on Rails, C# and ASP.NET, and Node/Typescript.

## Decision

Use C#, ASP.NET and Hackney's Clean Architecture framework, as specified in the [API Playbook](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/API-Playbook-v2-beta). These applications are intended to be a robust part of HackIT's platform and iterated upon and the HackIT team has mostly C# skillset.

## Consequences

Choosing this stack means that the HackIT team will be able to carry this application forward for future iterations and support.
